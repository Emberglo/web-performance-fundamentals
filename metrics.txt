where do we measure from?


Lab Data

    tools like Lighthouse

    dev manchine connected directly to server

    not really testing network

    extensions affect data - disable your exensions when testing or run the ones most likely to be run by your users


Synthetic Data

    text servers - run window of chrome and tell you how their instance of chrome ran the sites

    traditional apm tools do this - newrelic, etc

    sort of tests network


Field Data

    capture data from users from their own networks

    rum tools - real user monitoring tools - requestmeterics, etc

    more accurate - but noisy because lots of users have bad networks and bad computers

    don't care what all users see - focus on your intended audiance


CrUX - Chrome User Experience Report

    displays field data

    chrome collects real user data and publishes it monthly

    https://crux-compare.netlify.app/ - tool to look at this data

    75% of users had the listed experience or better


web.dev

    google's site about the core vitals and how they might change over time


Interpreting Field Data

    CrUX is only coming from chrome and edge - blink based browsers

    chromium is the overall browser - blink is the rendering engine - blink is where the web vitals collection happens

    gives a big sample size but still biased data

    all mobile data will come from android - ios doesn't contribute this data

    usually measured in median (percentiles) - averages can be misleading

    google cares about p75 number - shows where 75% of users have this score or better

    personally - p95 gives you an idea of what your worst user sees
