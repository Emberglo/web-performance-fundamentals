Need to gather metrics on site that needs improvement

    Entry Timings

        an entry is one network event - one request that has happened as part of this page

        performance.getEntries() or performance.getEntriesByType() or performance.getEntriesByName()

            return a list of entries with a bunch of properties

            properties correspond to different timings on the http request

    how we gather all of our performance data programatically and aggragate it across our whole user base


Performance Observer

    how we get all the entries 

    new PerformanceObserver(
        (entryList) => {
            var entries = entryList.getEntries();
        }
    ).observe(opts);

    how to observe events that happen at unknown points in time

    paint events, layout shift events, navigation events - all called entries

    performance timings are different kinds of objects than the performance observer - different kinds of entries


Web Vitals Library from Google will replace the code in the perf file

    good way of doing performance logging on a production app


How To Improve Performance

    do fewer things

    sending smaller/fewer files
