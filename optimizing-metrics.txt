Improving First Contentful Paint

    servers need to be quick

        needs to be sized correctly

            make sure your machine has plenty of memory, etc to handle requests
        
        minimal processing

            don't make unnecessary database requests or data manipulation

        network bandwidth

            have more than enough bandwidth to process all expected requests and some extra

    deliver small documents

        content size

            anything over 80-100k per page is too much

            images should be 1mb or less

        compression

            turn on gzip compression

            can use newer compressions like brotli
    
    short route through internet/network

        make sure to place your servers as close to your users as possible

            east coast servers to west coast customers - at least 200ms per request

        use content distrobution networks (CDNs)

            like cloudflare, maxCDN, etc

            caches a copy of your site and serves that to users requesting it
