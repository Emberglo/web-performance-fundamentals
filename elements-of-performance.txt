Why is performance important?

more performant sites/apps have better conversion rates and better revenue

#1 reason - Google says so - including performance in search rankings

#2 - angry and frustrated users don't stick around long - lose sales, etc

Percieved performance - if people expect things to take a certain amount of time - as long as its in the expect time, it's not so bad

Psychology of Waiting
1 - People want to get started with what they're there for
2 - Bored waits feel slower
3 - Anxious waits feel slower
4 - Unexplained waits feel slower
5 - Uncertain waits feel slower
6 - People will wait for value

The old way to measure performance: page load time
    things like lazy loading tricked this and made it useless

The new way: Web Vitals

4 different metrics - Core Web Vitals
1 - First Contentful Paint
2 - Largest Contentful Paint
3 - Cumulative Layout Shift
4 - First Input Delay


First Contentful Paint

respond quickly

from link click/url entered to the first content loads (ie: header bar)

time until the user seeds an indication that the page is loading


Largest Contentful Paint

get to the point

generally images cover the most area - so these are what end up getting measured

time until the user sees most the page and believes it is ready or almost ready


Cumulative Layout Shift

don't move stuff around after load

the total movement distance and impact of page elements during the entire lifetime of the document that the user sees

ie: ads or images loading and causing content to move around

have to be careful of this one with single page applications


First Input Delay

dont load too much stuff

how much of a delay between the page looking ready to use and when the first click handler can fire

the browser time delay between the users first click and the execution of applicable code



Lighthouse

in dev tools

move dev tools out of the window so you can have a normal size chrome window open

simulated throttling generally cuts your device speed in about half to replicated average machines

report is relative to your machine, network connection, chrome window size, and application priority
